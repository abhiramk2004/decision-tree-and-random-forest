erformed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using ydata-profiling to gain insights into the dataset’s characteristics.

Verified that the datasets were already preprocessed and ready for model development.

Applied train_test_split to divide the dataset into training and testing sets for cross-validation purposes.

Utilized StandardScaler to normalize the feature values for improved model performance.

Trained a Decision Tree Classifier using the training dataset.

Visualized the decision tree using Graphviz for interpretability.

Optimized the tree’s maximum depth to 10 to balance bias and variance.

Evaluated model performance using accuracy_score, confusion_matrix, and classification_report metrics.

Focused on reducing false negatives to improve the model’s recall.

Examined feature importances and identified that certain features had minimal impact on predictions.

Developed a Random Forest Classifier to leverage ensemble learning and improve overall model performance.

Applied GridSearchCV to tune hyperparameters such as n_estimators, max_depth, min_samples_split, min_samples_leaf, and max_features.

Compared the models using cross_val_score to ensure consistent and unbiased evaluation.

Documented all steps professionally, ensuring a robust and reproducible machine learning workflow.
